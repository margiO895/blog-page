# My yapping page

I got an inspiration for this project from web pages (mainly personal blogs) from the late 90s/ early 00s and I am going to try my best to recreate this "nostalgic" simplistic look. 
..and of course, I want to have something "mine" and social media profiles are just too much and too little at the same time for me.


Hopefully, you will like my yapping ( and I wont get bored of it)
:D
